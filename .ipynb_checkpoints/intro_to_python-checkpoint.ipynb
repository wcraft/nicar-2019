    "Python is a programming language that we can use to do a lot of different things!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how I use it in my day-to-day as a data reporter:\n",
    "* Analyze and visualize data\n",
    "* Build websites and interactives \n",
    "* Build and manage databases \n",
    "* Scrape PDFs for information \n",
    "\n",
    "In this session, we are going to go over the basics of Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Goals\n",
    "I hope that you come away from the class knowing enough that you can learn to use Pandas, a powerful data analysis library. Also, I want you to know enough to be able to google what you want to do in Python and be able to understand what you find. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Who am I? \n",
    "Hi! I am Will Craft. Pronouns he/him. \n",

    "## üêç Why use Python over Excel? \n",
    "Excel good for doing some stuff but but ...\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python is versatile \n",
    "I do almost all my work in python. Here's a sample workflow from a recent project:\n",
    "\n",
    "Get scanned PDF of data from local utility service -> Write python code to pull text data out of pdf -> Write code to parse the text data and turn it into a csv -> Use python to analyze data -> Visualize findings for publication \n",
    "\n",
    "You can use Python to scrape the web, make visuals, do statistics, write up the results of an investigation, build a website, and a whole lot more. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python is reproducible\n",
    "*Reproducibility* is important\n",
    "\n",
    "Excel is not reproducible. With Python, I can hand someone my original data and my code and they can re-create all my work with a few keystrokes. This is not possible with Excel unless you take meticulous notes about all the changes you make. Reproducibility reduces errors and allows for fact-checking\n",
    "\n",
    "If I get new data or I make a change to the data, I can run the same script and update my results. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python is shareable \n",
    "We are working in jupyter notebook, a program for doing python in bite sized chunks and sharing stuff. You can share your code with co-workers and the public. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lots of resources online for learning\n",
    "I do a lot of learning on the job. There are tons of resources for getting started:\n",
    "* NICAR: https://ire.org/resource-center/tipsheets/?q=python \n",
    "* Ben Welsh: http://www.firstpythonnotebook.org/\n",
    "* Django tutorials: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Tutorial_local_library_website\n",

    "We are using Python 3.7 and a program called pipenv. There are lots of packages that people have written to do different things, and these packages sometimes need different versions of Python and might conflict with one another. Pipenv creates and manages a virtual environment, a self-contained sandbox to install different packages. \n",
