    "Python is a programming language that we can use to do a lot of different things!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how I use it in my day-to-day as a data reporter:\n",
    "* Analyze and visualize data\n",
    "* Build websites and interactives \n",
    "* Scrape websites\n",
    "* Build and manage databases \n",
    "* Scrape PDFs for information \n",
    "\n",
    "In this session, we are going to go over the basics of Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Goals\n",
    "I hope that you come away from the class knowing enough that you can learn to use Pandas, a powerful data analysis library. Also, I want you to know enough to be able to google what you want to do in Python and be able to understand what you find. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Who am I? \n",
    "Hi! I am Will Craft. Pronouns he/him. \n",

    "\n",
    "Get scanned PDF of data from local utility service -> Write python code to pull text data out of pdf -> Write code to parse the text data and turn it into a csv -> Use python to analyze data -> Visualize findings for publication \n",

    "You can use Python to scrape the web, make visuals, do statistics, write up the results of an investigation, build a website, and a whole lot more. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python is reproducible\n",
    "*Reproducibility* is important\n",
    "\n",
    "Excel is not reproducible. With Python, I can hand someone my original data and my code and they can re-create all my work with a few keystrokes. This is not possible with Excel unless you take meticulous notes about all the changes you make. Reproducibility reduces errors and allows for fact-checking\n",
    "\n",
    "If I get new data or I make a change to the data, I can run the same script and update my results. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python is shareable \n",
    "We are working in jupyter notebook, a program for doing python in bite sized chunks and sharing stuff. You can share your code with co-workers and the public. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lots of resources online for learning\n",
